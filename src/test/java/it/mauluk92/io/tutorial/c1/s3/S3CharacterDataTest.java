     * characters are encoded by assigning each character in a given
     * script a number.
     * For example, in the common ASCII encoding, the character A
     * is mapped to the number 65; the character B is mapped to the number 66.

     * of language such as Unicode.
     * Internally, Java uses the Unicode character set.
