     * Input and output, I/O fort short, are fundamental
     * to any computer operating system or programming language.
     * Only theorists find it interesting to write programs
     * that don't require input or produce output. At the same time,
     * I/O hardly qualifies as one of the more thrilling topics in
     * computer science. It's something in the background, something
     * you use every day. But, in fact, there are plenty of
     * reasons Java programmers should fin I/O interesting. Java
     * includes a particularly rich set of I/O classes in the core API,
     * mostly in the java.io and java.nio packages.
     * These packages support several different styles of I/O.
     * One distinction is between byte oriented I/O, which is handled
     * by input/output streams, and character-I/O, which is handled
     * by readers and writers. Another distinction is between the old-style
     * stream based I/O and the new style channel and buffer I/O.
